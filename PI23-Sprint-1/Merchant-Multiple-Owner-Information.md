# User Story

As a DFSP user, I want to have an ability to add multiple owner information for each merchant so that these owner details can be stored and used for compliance and other purposes.

## Acceptance Criteria

- When I access the merchant acquiring portal, I should have the option to add a new merchant.

- While adding, I should be able to input details for multiple owners associated with the merchant entity. These details should include the owner's name, address, phone number, and email as per existing information request.

- A single merchant entity can have one or more owners. The system should allow me to add as many owners as necessary for each merchant.

- For each merchant, there should be a designated contact person. If there are multiple owners for a single merchant entity, and I choose to set the contact person's information the same as one of the owners, the system should provide a drop-down list of available owners to choose from.

- After selecting a single owner from the drop-down list as the contact person, the contact person's phone number and email should automatically populate with the corresponding information from the selected owner's details.

- If there is only one owner associated with a merchant, the system should automatically set that owner as the contact person when adding the merchant.
