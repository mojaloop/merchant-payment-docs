# User Story
**As a merchant**, **I want to** be able to self-register in the merchant payment ecosystem, **so that** I can efficiently and effectively become a part of the system.
 
## Acceptance Criteria

1. When a merchant accesses the merchant registration portal, they should be prompted to provide information including Merchant Business Name, Email or phone number, and whether they are already in the system.
 
2. If the merchant is already in the system, they must provide their alias ID. If not, a confirmation box should appear to confirm their intent to create a new account.
 
3. Regardless of being new or existing, the system should initiate an account verification process with email verification.
 
4. After successful verification, new merchants should be allowed to register and request an alias.
 
5. For existing merchants, post-verification, they should be able to view their merchant entity information and have the ability to change the DFSP (Digital Financial Service Provider) they are registered with.
 
## Additional Acceptance Criteria
- If a merchant selects "yes" to being already in the system and the system doesn't find any alias matching their input, an error message should be displayed.
 
## Further Improvements
- For existing merchants, the system should support DFSP change requests, allowing them flexibility in choosing their financial service provider.
- Medium and large merchants should have the option to add new checkout counters and provide location information for enhanced operational flexibility.
