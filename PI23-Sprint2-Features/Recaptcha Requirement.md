## User Story:
**As an administrator**, **I want to** ensure that the portal is protected from automated bots and malicious activities **so that** I can have a secure and smooth browsing experience.

Acceptance Criteria:

1. **Display of reCAPTCHA:**
   - When a user attempts to perform an action that requires protection (ie signning up and logging in), a reCAPTCHA challenge should be displayed on the web page.

2. **Clear and Accessible Instructions:**
   - The reCAPTCHA challenge should include clear and concise instructions for the user to follow.
   - The instructions should be presented in a format that is easily readable and accessible to users with disabilities.

3. **User Interaction:**
   - Users should be able to interact with the reCAPTCHA challenge using commonly used input devices such as keyboard and mouse or touch interfaces on mobile devices.
   - The challenge should not rely on specific technologies or devices that might exclude certain user groups.

4. **Verification Process:**
   - After completing the reCAPTCHA challenge, the user should receive prompt feedback on whether the verification was successful.
   - If the verification is successful, the user should be allowed to proceed with the intended action.
   - If the verification fails, there should be clear guidance on how to retry the challenge or seek alternative verification methods.

5. **Accessibility:**
   - The reCAPTCHA challenge must comply with web accessibility standards (e.g., WCAG) to ensure it is usable by people with disabilities.
   - Provide alternative methods or accommodations for users who may have difficulty completing standard reCAPTCHA challenges, such as audio challenges or alternative verification options.

6. **Responsive Design:**
   - The reCAPTCHA challenge should be responsive and adapt to different screen sizes and resolutions to ensure a consistent user experience across various devices.

7. **Timeouts and Expiry:**
   - Implement a reasonable timeout period for the reCAPTCHA challenge to prevent the session from expiring while the user is attempting to complete the challenge.

8. **Logging and Monitoring:**
   - Implement logging mechanisms to record instances of reCAPTCHA challenges, successful verifications, and failures.
   - Set up monitoring to detect any unusual patterns or potential abuse related to reCAPTCHA usage.

9. **QA Testing:**
