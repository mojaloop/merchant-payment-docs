# Simple merchant registration 
## Registration Save As Draft Feature 

**As a** merchant and DFSP operator, **I want to** get save as draft feature for my work-in-progress application form **so that** I can save my progress and prevent any loss of work when my work gets interrupted. 

### Acceptance Criteria

* Save work-in-progress application form as draft and reload the progress when user want to continue filling out the form.
* When user clicks "save and proceed" button, 
  * On first attempt of the record, merchant ID should be generated by the system and the data should be recorded to the database associated with the merchant ID generated. 
  * everytime user clicks "save and proceed", updated data will be recorded to the database with the existing merchant ID.
* Next time user enters the system and navigate to add new merchant page, user will see "continue saved draft application", " add new record" buttons.  
* when user clicks " continue saved draft application", work-in-progress of saved draft will be reloaded and users can continue filling the form.
