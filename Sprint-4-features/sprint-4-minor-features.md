## Logout

**As a** user (any type of user(hub user, DFSP user, merchant)), **I want** to log out anytime I want with a click of a button.

* After logging out, login page should be redirected and authentication tokens should be removed.

### Design File

* [logout with icon](https://www.figma.com/proto/sEFusJJ4pQedgXvfRixE7b/Merchant-Registry-Prototype?page-id=1435%3A7881&type=design&node-id=1500-8894&viewport=644%2C-1531%2C0.48&t=hCq5f5htO8ZoIX23-1&scaling=scale-down&starting-point-node-id=1500%3A8894)

## session time out

* session timeout limit = 1 day

## adding maker username in merchant table

* adding maker names can help users to check which records they should check and approve, without knowing record maker, they might waste time by checking the records when they don't have permission to give approval or rejection.
